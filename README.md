Description:
Mfocus is a web application which aims to help college students to manage their daily tasks.
The main body of Mfocus is a to-do list to help users manage tasks. The main purpose of this project is to help users to finish their daily tasks efficiently and to help their schedule more clearly laid out.
What makes Mfocus stand out from a usual to-do list application is that Mfocus has a unique reward system. Through raising a pet on the webpage, it motivates the users to finish their tasks. The pet will need food, medicine as well as toys etc. and those items can be found at the “e-shop” on this website. In order to buy these items the user needs to complete tasks to earn coins. So this pet will motivate the user to finish their tasks. There will also be a music player which allows users to log into their Spotify account and play music. Both the pet and music player can help the user to relax and make them feel less stressful.
